              The Association for Computing Machinery does not issue formal <em>invitation</em>
              letters for visas. However, we can issue a visa <em>support</em> letter. ACM is able to provide visa support letters to attendees as well as authors with accepted papers, posters, or members of the conference committee. 
              
              <br> 
              For visa support letters, refer all requests to
              to <a href="mailto:supportletters@acm.org">supportletters@acm.org</a>. Please allow up to 10 business
              days to receive a letter. All requests are handled in the order they are received. 
              The information below should be included with the request:
            </p>

            <ul class="topics-list">
              <li>Your name as it appears on your passport</li>
              <li>Your current postal mailing address</li>
              <li>The name of the conference you are registering for</li>
              <li>Your registration confirmation number</li>
              <li>If you have any papers accepted for the conference, please provide the title and indicate whether you are the “sole author” or a “co-author” </li>
              <li>Authors may indicate their paper title. If no paper, speakers can provide the title of their presentation</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              ACM does not provide letters for transport of vendor or presenter equipment.  
              ACM suggests shipping the materials insured to the conference facility.
